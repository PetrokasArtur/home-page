                    <span>The N95 mask</span> is a form of respiratory protective wear worn over the nose and mouth
                    to help
                    minimise
                    the chance of inhaling airborne particles like viruses and other germs. It is a disposable mask
                    made from synthetic polymer fibres produced in a highly specialised process called melt blowing.
                    During this process, the inner layer of the N95 mask is created which forms the filtration layer
                    capable of filtering out at <span>least 95%</span> of airborne particles when worn correctly.
                </p>

                <p>During outbreaks of respiratory illnesses and during periods of intense
                    air pollution, wearing <span>N95 masks</span> has been shown to help reduce the inhalation of
                    compromised
                    air,
                    filtering out nasty pathogens which lead to illness or which can aggravate existing
                    respiratory
                    problems. Maintaining clear and unhindered respiration is vitally important for remaining fit
                    and
                    healthy and people with pre-existing conditions or respiratory fragility can particularly
                    benefit from wearing face masks while they are out in public and unable to control the
                    breathing
                    environments that they find themselves in.</p>

            <div class="description-resperator">
                <p>
                    Most N95 respirators are manufactured for use in construction and other industrial type jobs
                    that
                    expose
                    workers to dust and small particles. They are regulated by the National Personal Protective
                    Technology
                    Laboratory (NPPTL) in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which
                    is
                    part of
                    the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

                    However, some N95 respirators are intended for use in a health care setting. Specifically,
                    single-use,
                    disposable respiratory protective devices used and worn by health care personnel during
                    procedures
                    to
                    protect both the patient and health care personnel from the transfer of microorganisms, body
                    fluids,
                    and
                    particulate material. These surgical N95 respirators are class II devices regulated by the FDA,
                    under 21 CFR
                    878.4040, and CDC NIOSH under 42 CFR Part 84.
